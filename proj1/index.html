		Overview
	</h3>
		<p> With this project I was able to implement a simple rasterizer using techniques from lecture. This included drawing
			triangles, supersampling, transforms, and texture mapping. I think what was interesting was after this project I feel 
			I have a strong grasp on what supersampling is because I spent so long debugging it.
